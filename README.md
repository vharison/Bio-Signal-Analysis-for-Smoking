🧠 Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking Detection
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing physiological bio-signal data to detect smoking behavior using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to move beyond self-reported data and explore objective, data-driven indicators of smoking activity.

🎯 Problem Statement

Smoking status is often self-reported, which can be inaccurate or incomplete.
By leveraging bio-signal data, this project aims to identify distinct physiological patterns associated with smoking events.
